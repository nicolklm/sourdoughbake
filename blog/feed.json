After</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">much research, nagging many fantastic bakers, and watching more YouTube videos than I can keep track of, I finally figured out the secret to understanding baker’s math and why it’s important.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Baker’s math, </span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">helps</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> you understand the recipes</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">, and</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> let’s you adapt someone else’s recipe to your taste. Simply put, it is the recipe that the baker use to make their bread. Instead of being in cups or grams, it’s measured in percentages. It breaks the bread down into its most basic parts, flour, hydration, salt and starter (There can be more ingredients but we are keeping it simple). This way it allows us to scale up or down a recipe - which will</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">tell us how many grams of an ingredient we will need.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">The key to understanding baker's math lies in the flour. It is of course the most important part of your bread. In baker’s math, flour is always represented as 100%. We can look at the example I mentioned above: 70% bread flour, 30% wheat, 70% hydration, 1.8% salt. You’ll notice there are two types of flour being</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">used, and their percentages add up to 100. If we made a bread that had 4 cups of bread flour, in baker’s math, that would be represented as 100% bread flour. If you had a recipe that called for 200 grams of bread flour, 200g</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">rams</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> of rye flour, 200g</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">rams </span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">of all-purpose flour and 200g</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">rams</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> of spelt, those 800</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">grams</span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> would also be represented as 25% bread, 25% rye, 25% all purpose, 25% spelt flour.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">The total weight of all your flour is the starting point for every other percentage in the formula. But for the other percentages to mean anything, you need to determine how much flour you are going to use.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Hydration</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">;</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> typically this just means water. We will talk about other liquids that can be added to breads in a future post. For now let’s just assume that when you see hydration, it means water. In baker’s math, the total amount of water in a recipe is compared to the amount of flour. The simplest example would be if you</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">had half as much water as you do flour, then you would have 50% hydration. I</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">think the sweet spot for new bakers is between 65% and 70% hydration, depending on what kind of bread you are making. Higher hydration doughs are much stickier but can produce larger holes in your bread, or as we call it in the</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">baking world, a larger crumb.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Let’s take a moment and look at an example. I use about 475 grams of flour to make one loaf of bread. I know I want to make a 75% hydrated loaf. Step one would be to determine that 75% of 475 (grams of flour) is 356 grams of water. </span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">We will cover the arithmetic below, but assume you want to use 20% of starter in this formula. Still using the same total weight of flour, we now figure out the weight of the starter. 20% of 475 would mean that you </span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">would </span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">need 95 grams of starter.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Keep in mind that our starters are made of water and flour. We know that half of</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">that 95 grams of starter is water weight, which needs to be subtracted from the Total Water weight to determine how much water needs to be added when mixing. In this case, to get the total of 356 grams of water, we need to subtract 47</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">grams of water</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">from the total</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">(since that amount is coming from</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">our starter</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">)</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">which means</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">that</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> 261 grams is the amount of water</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">you need to weigh and add to your dough.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">(add excel chart)</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Congratulations, you now understand the most “complicated” part of bakers math. All that we have left to cover is starter and salt and those are just additional ingredients calculated based on the total amount of flour. Since we are on the subject, let's talk about our sourdough starter.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Typically, bakers use a 20% ratio of starter to flour when they bake. If you just did the math in your head to figure out 20% of 475, then you get an A+ for the day.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">20%</span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">of 475 grams of flour is 95g</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">rams</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">, which is the total</span></span></span></span> <span style=\"color: #c45911;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\">starter</span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> weight </span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">in grams</span></span></span></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\"> you are going to be adding to your dough.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">Salt is the exact same thing. Typically the amount of salt added into a loaf is between 1.8% and 2.2%. It’s a personal choice you need to make based on your taste preferences and your relationship with salt. Yes, you can bake breads with 1% of salt or less, but they will be fairly bland. Still, at the end of the day, you are the one who will be eating your bread, so use the percentage you are comfortable with.</span></span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: large;\"><span lang=\"x-none\">There it is folks, baker’s math in a nutshell.
